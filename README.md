# About this repository
In June 2019, GitHub announced template repositories: an easy way to create repositories with a certain structure. So I decided to push my regular research project template here.

# What to consider?
Of course when it comes to create a folder structure, there is no right way: what it means to have a good folder structure varies for a person, set of tools, methodology and so on. For instance, I have a slightly different structure for projects with simulations than projects with experiments. But if I have to list what a good structure should have, I would list 

  * __Intuitiveness:__ When I am looking for some item in my project folder, but not sure where did I put, does my first try lead me to the right place? If not, it is a good sign to change the structure. 
  * __Practicality:__ Most of the time there is a trade-off between well-organized and easy to reach. It might be nice to have very well organized folders. However if it takes me more to get in the right folder (for instance the R that generates a bar plot from the data is in `./code/R/plots/barplot.R`) comparing to the situation where all my files in the same folder (complete madness), something seem to be wrong. I guess a target can be to minimize the expected "search and rescue time" for the files weighted on the the frequency of usage.
